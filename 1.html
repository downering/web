<p>I live far from school, so it takes a lot of time to go to school in the morning.

- If I lived closer to school, I could save more time / would be able to save more time.

I go to work 6 times a week. So, it's hard to make plans on weekends.

- If I went to work just 5 times a week, I could / would be able to do more things on weekends.

I have an external hard drive, so I can carry my music and movies wherever I go.

- But if I didn't have one, I couldn't / wouldn't be able to do that .

I gain weight quite easily. So I have to be careful about what I eat.

+ I would be able to/ could enjoy food more freely.</p>

<p><p style="margin-top:45px;">- If it rains this weekend, I'm going to stay home.

- If she asks, I'm just going to pretend I don't know anything.

- If I get off work early tody, I'm going to meet up with some freinds for some drinks.

- If this happens again, they're going to lose everything.
